# DubDubDown

DubDubDown is a very simple app, which lets you know exactly when the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC20 by Apple<a/> will be started. Plus, it sends a notification (If you click Remind Me button) when the conference is about to start.

This includes a watchOS app, as well as a macOS app. 

You can get benifit of the countdown technique or even nothing from this open-source app, I just made this when I was bored.
